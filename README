BBDB is the Insidious Big Brother Database for GNU Emacs. It
provides an address book for email and snail mail addresses, phone
numbers and the like. It can be linked with various Emacs mail
clients (Message and Mail mode, Rmail, Gnus, MH-E, and VM).
BBDB is fully customizable.

BBDB is available at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bbdb/
To check it out, use
git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/bbdb.git

Usage notes

This revised version of BBDB requires GNU Emacs 23 or newer.
Its code is still under development.  While it should work reliably,
users of previous versions of BBDB are advised that the format of
the BBDB database file has changed.  Migration to the new format should
happen automatically.  Yet it is recommended to make a copy of the
old file, in case something unexpected happens or you might want
to go back.

The BBDB info manual is still awaiting a more complete overhaul.

As compared with BBDB v2.xx, many variables, functions, and commands
have changed in BBDB v3.  Most likely you will have to review your
customizations carefully.  You may want to call bbdb-undocumented-variables
to identify outdated (i.e., now usually undocumented) variables in
your init file.  All user variables in BBDB v3 are listed at the beginning
of bbdb.el.


BBDB interface with mail user agents (MUAs)
===========================================

BBDB can interface with various mail user agents (MUAs).
These include Rmail, Gnus, VM, MH-E, Message and Mail mode.
This lets you 

 - display the BBDB records for the sender and/or recipients of a
   message you are viewing

 - create or update the BBDB records for the sender and/or
   recipients of a message

 - add annotations to the BBDB records for the sender and/or
   recipients of a message

There are two ways for BBDB to interface with MUAs:

Interactive commands
--------------------

Call bbdb-initialize (usually in your init file) to initialize
the MUA interfaces based on interactive commands

MUA commands include

  bbdb-mua-display-records, bbdb-mua-display-sender, bbdb-mua-display-recipients
  bbdb-annotate-record, bbdb-mua-annotate-sender, bbdb-mua-annotate-recipients
  bbdb-mua-edit-field, bbdb-mua-edit-field-sender, bbdb-mua-edit-field-recipients

These MUA commands operate either on existing records only. Or they
can create new records.

They are all controlled by bbdb-mua-update-interactive-p.
This is a cons pair (WITHOUT-PREFIX . WITH-PREFIX).
The car is used if the command is called without a prefix.
The cdr is used if the command is called with a prefix (and if the prefix
        is not used for another purpose).

Allowed values are (here ADDRESS is an email address found in a message):
 nil          Do nothing.
 search       Search for existing records matching ADDRESS.
 update       Search for existing records matching ADDRESS;
                update name and mail field if necessary.
 query        Search for existing records matching ADDRESS;
                query for creation of a new record if the record does not exist.
 create or t  Search for existing records matching ADDRESS;
                create a new record if it does not yet exist.
 a function   This functions will be called with no arguments.
                It should return one of the above values (see below).
 read         Read the value interactively.

BBDB v2 also used MUA-specific variables bbdb/MUA-update-records-mode
to control its interfaces with MUAs. In BBDB v3 the variables
bbdb/MUA-update-records-p are only used as fallback if the generic
(MUA-independent) variables bbdb-mua-update-interactive-p,
bbdb-update-records-p or bbdb-mua-auto-update-p result in a value of
nil for the arg UPDATE-P of bbdb-update-records.

Noninteractive functions
------------------------

Call bbdb-mua-auto-update-init (usually in your init file)
to hook BBDB's hook function bbdb-mua-auto-update into the MUAs.

bbdb-mua-auto-update automatically displays or updates the BBDB records
for the sender and/or recipients of a message. Its behavior is controlled
by bbdb-mua-auto-update-p. This may take the same values as
bbdb-mua-update-interactive-p (except read).

Binding this to a function is often most helpful for noninteractive use.
For example, you may want to bind bbdb-mua-auto-update-p to the function
bbdb-select-message,  see bbdb-accept-message-alist and
bbdb-ignore-message-alist.  If a message is accepted by bbdb-select-message,
the actual action performed by BBDB (i.e., the return value of
bbdb-select-message) is given by bbdb-mua-update-records-p.
