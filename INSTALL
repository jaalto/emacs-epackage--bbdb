To compile and install BBDB with `make':

0) (BBDB development version only)

   Configure the configure process:

   Run `autoconf' in the top directory of the BBDB code.
   This creates the `configure' script required for step 1).

1) Configure the build process:

   Run the `configure' script in the top directory of the BBDB code.
   This performs a number of checks on your system and generates the
   Makefiles accordingly.

   The `configure' script comes with various options:

   `--with-emacs=PROG' selects a GNU Emacs program to use.
     This defaults to emacs. You need at least GNU Emacs 23.

   `--with-vm-dir=DIR' specifies the path where VM can be found.
     Without this option the resulting BBDB build does not support VM.

   Use `configure --help' to see all available options.

2) Build BBDB:

   To build BBDB type 'make bbdb'.

   If you use the BBDB development version, but you do not have autoconf,
   go to the lisp directory and type 'make --makefile=./makefile-temp'.
   (The file lisp/makefile-temp will be deleted in the repository when
   BBDB v3 is released with a configure script.)

3) Install BBDB:

   i)   If the BBDB lisp files are in a directory
        "/path/to/bbdb/lisp" you can use in your emacs init file

        (require 'bbdb-loaddefs "/path/to/bbdb/lisp/bbdb-loaddefs.el")

        This adds "/path/to/bbdb/lisp" to the load-path; so it is all
        you need to make BBDB known to your Emacs.

   ii)  Add the BBDB texinfo subdirectory to the Info search path.

   iii) Add the BBDB tex subdirectory to the TeX search path
        This can be done, for example, by adding the path to the
        BBDB tex subdirectory to the environment variable TEXINPUTS.

   `make install' installs these files in their usual system directories.
   These directories are listed in the output of the configure script.
   You can override them via respective options for this script.

   `make install' is not required to run BBDB.
